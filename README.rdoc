= ICUnicode

Unicode sorting is complicated (http://unicode.org/reports/tr10), and Ruby doesn't do it
correctly. But there is a widely-used implementation of the Unicode collation algorithm in
the ICU (International Components for Unicode) libraries. There is also no way to do
Transliteration in Ruby (http://userguide.icu-project.org/transforms/general). This gem is
a simple C wrapper around ucol_getSortKey from the ICU Collation API and utrans_transUChars
from the ICU Transliteration API. These are added as simple methods on String.

== Usage:

  ["cafe", "cafes", "caf\303\251"].sort
  => ["cafe", "cafes", "caf\303\251"]

  require 'icunicode'

  ["cafe", "cafes", "caf\303\251"].sort_by {|s| s.unicode_sort_key}
  => ["cafe", "caf\303\251", "cafes"]

  "blueberry".transliterate("Katakana").transliterate("Latin")
  => "burueberrui"

  "blueberry".transliterate("Greek").transliterate("Latin")
  => "blyeberry"

== Install:

You must install ICU first. You can download the source from http://site.icu-project.org/download,
or on Mac, you can either install with MacPorts:

  sudo port install icu
  
Or, if you're using homebrew:

  brew install icu4c
  export cppflags=`brew --prefix icu4c`/include
  export ldflags=`brew --prefix icu4c`/lib

Then install the gem:

  gem install icunicode

== To do:

Add support for locales other than en-US. Increase buffer size or make it grow dynamically.
